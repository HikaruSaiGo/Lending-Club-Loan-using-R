# Lending-Club-Loan-using-R

The goal of the project is to apply the Machine Learning Algorithms to the Lending Club data from 2012-2014. And to equal or improve on the accuracies already achieved, see the github for the competition LoanDefault-Prediction. (Note: It might have been more accurate to use Classification in the title of the github. The competition is to build a classifier not a numeric prediction model.)

Step 1 – collect data

Step 2 – exploring and preparing the data

Step 3 – training a model on the data

Step 4 – evaluating model performance

Step 5 – improving model performance

### Extra Credit: 

Once decided on the best model, refit it using all of the 2012-2014 data and then use the model to classify all of the 2015 data. Check the accuracy of your predictions.
